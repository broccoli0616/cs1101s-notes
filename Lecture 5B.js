1. javascipt is the target language 
x 86-64 is the source language -- is the interpreter which is used to run game 
written in javascript
2. backend; x86-64 are both a source language and a hardware
architecture and the machine language that the hardware understands
The interpretor is written in x86 and understands elixir, so it 
can translate elixir into x86 instructions to be executed on the processor 

interpretor written in javascript can understand source languge which is used 
to write the programme, can be directly run in the hardware (browser with java 
script interpreter)

2. compiler, translate one language to another 
compiler hardware: Its the processor we use when we do the compilation.
compilation process will happen at the browser with certain language 

each compiler will have crorepsonding hardware, if it is in broswser interpreter
need a real hardware interpreter to process 

if you want to run on a x86-64 hardware , need have a x86-64 interpreter 
higher order language to lower order langauge, use the compiler to quickly go to 
the hardware language where hardware run the programme 

An interpreter actually runs your programs. 
A compiler just translates them. Different thing. Not comparable.


a programme should be run in the hardware while a compilation process will 
happen at the browser with certain language like javascript browser, 
and with series of interpreter, the compilation process will be eventually 
executed at the x86-64 hardware which is the computer

the hardware interpreter run the programme eventually and 
programme will be run at each Interpretation. Can I understand in 
the way that compilation is a programme that need to be run at the hardware as well?
